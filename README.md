_This is an MVC web application using C#/.Net core and displaying the use of RESTful Routing.  The concept is that a bakery or storefront owner, Pierre, can track his many vendors that are requesting his wares.  Pierre can add vendors to his list to track and then within each vendor, orders can be added.  Additional notes can be added, such as, "I need 40 of these by Friday".  There are links on each page that can be used to navigate back to vendor page and home page._
